## Boom\!  \-\-  Particle Explosion Simulation


</div>

### Description

Boom! is a particle explosion simulation. It simulates explosions composed of many individual elastic pieces. Each piece also has a shadow, which has a very nice effect when the explosion occurs over a detailed background graphic.

<br><br>

Boom! is a fun little side project that I devised while looking for a quick way to put explosions into another game I'm writing. It turned out well enough to warrant a GUI so that the user can tweak the particle properties. There is also a 'multiball' feature, so that you can start up several explosions at once!

<br><br>

In this simulation, each particle is an instance of the same class. I used this approach to show how easy it is to create an array of similar objects, each with dynamic property values. It makes for very concise and understandable code!
